# ConsoleRPG
The soure code for a Console-based fantasy RPG I'm working on. Released under the GNU GPL v3 license. You are free to modify the code as you will.



This game, which as of right now has no name, is a fantasy rpg I've been working on in Java. I decided to go ahead and release the code publicly so others can view
and modify it. The code is under the **GNU GPL v3 license** as stated above, which allows anyone to modify and even distribute the code as they want. You are free to
study, share, modify, distribute, etc. the code.
